The moving objects remain in the data, but they are not expressed because we set the singular values that correspond to their singular vectors to be zero. If we set the large singular values to zero instead of the relatively small ones, we'll pull out the high-frequency components. That is, the movement will come back, and the background will disappear.

The following code will provide an example solution to what we ask for in the lab's third section.
