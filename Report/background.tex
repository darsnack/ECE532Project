This section should explain the context for the main idea behind the project (you may divide this section into multiple subsections if it helps with readability). Start with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with citations) of how the problem came about, why it’s important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you’d like to talk about. Feel free to use images/diagrams/etc. from research papers, the internet, or other sources to help with your explanation, so long as you cite your references. Finally, the background section should also give a mathematical description of the problem, with equations as needed.
