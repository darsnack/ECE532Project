This short section (about 1/2 page) should clearly explain what the project is about, which machine learning techniques are explained and utilized, and what a reader can expect to learn and accomplish if they follow along and work through the examples and problems. This is a very important part of your project, because itâ€™s the first thing the reader sees. Be clear, be concise, and use this opportunity to convey what makes this project interesting/unique/cool.
