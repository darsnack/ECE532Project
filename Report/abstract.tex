This lab uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on video data to explore the idea of a low-rank approximation to a video and to perform some video editing tasks. The lab begins with an outline of the idea of the SVD, and then begins exploring low-rank approximations to image data. Afterwards, the structure of video data is explored and manipulated to allow the SVD to be applied in a productive way.

By structuring video data in a ``flat'' way, the concepts underlying the SVD and low-rank approximations are explored through interesting, relevant examples. In addition to building a more solid basis in the theory of the SVD, this lab will allow the student to explore the effects of preprocessing the data that they analyze, and the lab will conclude with an example of how the SVD might be used to edit video data, combining the previous work done throughout the lab.
