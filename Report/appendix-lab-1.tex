The following code will provide an example solution to what we ask for in the lab's first section.
\lstinputlisting[style=code,title=Lab1.m]{../Code/Lab1.m}

We convert the video into a matrix that has dimensions $76800 \times 141$. Doing the reverse ($141 \times 76800$) produces results which look more like doing a low-rank approximation for every frame.
