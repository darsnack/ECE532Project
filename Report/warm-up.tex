This section should pose a few (3 or 4) short problems. Think of this as a way of testing whether the reader was paying attention while reading the previous section. These can be math problems, or computational in nature. Either way, they should be short-answer problems, not too difficult, and should serve to prepare the reader for the more difficult tasks that lie ahead. For example, if the reader is expected to use a particular Matlab package later on, this would be a good place to introduce that package and give a simple problem to solve. Solutions to the warm-up should be included in the appendix.

\textit{This might be a good place to split into subsections}
