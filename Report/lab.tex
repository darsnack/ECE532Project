This is the main section of the report. It should contain 3 to 5 longer tasks that call on the reader to solve, analyze, visualize, and discuss problems related to the main theme of the project. Each problem may be accompanied by additional explanations if necessary (you can also use multiple subsections if it helps). The problems don’t need to be in a list; you may elect to intersperse the problems within your text but be sure to clearly label them so the reader knows what they’re being asked to do. With regards to format, use your best judgement for what makes your report most readable. If you are using external data files/sources, be sure to address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated?). Complete solutions to the lab problems should be included in the appendix.

\textit{This might be a good place to split into subsections}
